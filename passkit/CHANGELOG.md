## 0.0.9

- Increase [`intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) version range, which makes it compatible with older Flutter versions
- Allow older versions of `archive`, `image`, `json_annotation`, `pointycastle` which should make version conflicts less likely
- Allow the library to be used on Dart 3.3 and newer

## 0.0.7

- The library is now able to create properly signed `pkpass` files that work with Apple Wallet.
  Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/ueman/passkit/blob/master/passkit/SIGNING.md) to learn more.

## 0.0.5

- Export [Wallet Order Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletorders) related classes
- Rename `skipVerification` to `skipChecksumVerification`. 
  - This is a breaking change.
- Rename `PkPassImage` to `PkImage`.
  - This is a breaking change

## 0.0.4
